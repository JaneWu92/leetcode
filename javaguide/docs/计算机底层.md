* Operating Systems - Three Easy Pieces

### data bus, address bus, control

* 内存的最小单位是byte。
* data bus
    * A databus that consists of 8 bits(wires), can transfer 1 byte of data per read/write operation
    * A databus that consists of 16 bits(wires), can transfer 2 bytes of data per read/write operation
    * A databus that consists of 32 bits(wires), can transfer 4 bytes of data per read/write operation
* address bus
    * A address bus that consists of 16 wires (= bits), can convey 216 (= 64K) different addresses ==> each address contains a byte
    * A address bus that consists of 24 wires (= bits), can convey 224 (= 16M) different addresses ==> each address contains a byte
 
### computer resource
microprocessor // cpu
random access memory // main memory
keyboard, vidio display// IO device
disk drive // storage
 
### instruction set
* https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fx411Q7Ao 
* LOAD
* ADD
* STORE
* COMPARE
* JUMP IF CONDITION
* JUMP
* IN
* OUT

### system call
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_call
* 应该说任何跟资源相关的，都要system call。你就看computer到底有哪些资源
    * computer资源
        * CPU 
        * memory
        * hard drive
        * IO device
    * system call类别
        * create/terminate/wait process
        * memory allocation/free
        * create/delete/wirte/read file
        * request/release/detach/attach/read/write device
        *
        
### inter-process communication
* pipeline
