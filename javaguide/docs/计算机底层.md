* 内存的最小单位是byte。
* data bus
    * A databus that consists of 8 bits(wires), can transfer 1 byte of data per read/write operation
    * A databus that consists of 16 bits(wires), can transfer 2 bytes of data per read/write operation
    * A databus that consists of 32 bits(wires), can transfer 4 bytes of data per read/write operation
* address bus
    * A address bus that consists of 16 wires (= bits), can convey 216 (= 64K) different addresses ==> each address contains a byte
    * A address bus that consists of 24 wires (= bits), can convey 224 (= 16M) different addresses ==> each address contains a byte
