### binary vs ASCII
All files are at heart binary files -- that is, a collection of 1s and 0s.  
And ASCII is one of the way that use numbers to represent the number and letters.  
And it's all about how we view it.
Let's say we have different files which all contains "hello" text only.  
like: plain text file, rich text format file, word document, unicode plain text file.  
We can use a hex editor to see what is exactly the "binary collection" in these files.

### source code to executable binary file

### Processors Read and Interpret Instructions Stored in Memory
souce code
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
printf("hello, world\n");
return 0;
}
```
assembly code
```aidl
1 main:
2 subq $8, %rsp
3 movl $.LC0, %edi
4 call puts
5 movl $0, %eax
6 addq $8, %rsp
7 ret
```

let's say we have a hello file which is compiled as executable file.  
and when we type "./hello" in bash and then click enter key, it will be executed and print out "hello world".  

### Process
Process it the abstraction of OS on CPU, main memory and IO devices.  
So it can provide the illusion that each program is the only one running on the system.  
And the context swith is the mechanism to concurrently run multiple processes.  
So the context involve, content of main memory, PC, register files.
